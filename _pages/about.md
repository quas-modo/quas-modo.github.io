I am a first-year PhD student at Fudan University, jointly advised by Prof. [BoWen Zhou](https://c3i.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/author/bowen-zhou/) and Prof. [Xin Peng](https://cspengxin.github.io/). In parallel with my PhD, I work as an intern at the Embodied AI Center, [Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/),  supervised by [Jiangmiao Pang](https://oceanpang.github.io/) and [Yilun Chen](https://yilunchen.com/about/). Prior to my PhD, I earned my B.Eng degree at Nanjing University with honors.

I am actively exploring robotic manipulation and the integration of vision-language models (VLMs) with robotics. Always happy to chat, collaborate, or just make new friendsâ€”drop me a message anytime!

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
